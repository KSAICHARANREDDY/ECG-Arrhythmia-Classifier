             <h5>An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a simple test that can be used to check your heart's rhythm and electrical activity. Sensors attached to the skin are used to detect the electrical signals produced by your heart each time it beats. These signals are recorded by a machine and are looked at by a doctor to see if they're unusual. An ECG may be requested by a heart specialist (cardiologist) or any doctor who thinks the patient might have a problem with your heart, including Patient GP. That's the result of this test we will analyze .</h5>
